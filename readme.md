This is a todo-list made with vanilla JS. I was studying the submit event and all I can do with it.

![Alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shinspiegel/todo-list-vanilla-javascript/master/TodoListMockup.jpg)

I did use only **HTML5**, **CSS** and **JS**. It uses local storage for persistence, but can be easyly change for any database.

I have used [Parcel Bundler](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) for the bundling and converting JS for all browsers.

**Want to test it?**

```
git clone;
npm i;
npm run dev;
```
